        <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
        <p>Smiskis are small collectable figurines of green, glow-in-the-dark people. They originated in Japan and are sold in “blind boxes” grouped by various series. These blind boxes contain an unknown Smiski, so that the buyer does not know which one they will receive until they open the package. This concept grew in popularity as people aimed to collect all models of a series. There are 15 series with 6 figures per series, and 1 secret figure, totaling 105 unique Smiskis.</p>
        <p>Due to the large number of various Smiskis, collectors often encounter disorganization and confusion when it comes to their valued collectibles. As individuals purchase more Smiskis, it can be difficult to keep track of what they already own and what editions they would like to purchase in the future. The official Smiski company does not currently provide an application for users to keep track of their collectibles.</p>
        <p>There is currently a website <a href="https://www.smi.ski/">Smiski Tracker</a> that provides a list of all the Smiski figures, grouped by series. Its only function appears to be selecting and deselecting images of the figures, changing the saturation of the images. This does not allow users to search for specific Smiskis, nor for further organization to keep track of their personal collection. This idea could be a helpful resource to explore because it can improve customer engagement and enhance the user experience.</p>

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>Your proposal will also contain a description of the web app that you will create to help address your chosen problem (a proposed "solution"). Think about what kind of a web app would help with this problem, and how people would use that app to make their lives better in some way. What is the "use case" or "user story"Links to an external site. for the app?</p>
